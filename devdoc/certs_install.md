# Certs Install and Renewal

## Certificate System Descriptions (CSD)

CSD:s describe / list:
- All files related to installing or renewing certificates for particular system or application (e.g. Apache, MicroHTTPD, GitLab, Postfix, XRDP ...). Note: The app can be any app that will use certificates, not only web appplication
- How the files installed / renewed will be composed or generated by:
  - Concatenating multiple files (typically 2-3) into a certificate bundle
  - Generating files (typically by **openssl**) from individual files

NOTE: Linux (and BSD) distribution vendors usually have their own way of naming and laying out the certificate and private key files into their directory structure, thus - as an example - one configuration for Apache is not sufficient. Instead there may need to be separate configs for:
- Apache source code distribution
- Apache package within Debian or Ubuntu (even these may be differtent)
- Apache package within RedHat, Centos or Rocky (distribution within the same family *tend* to be named and located the same way)
- Apache package within FreeBSD

Examples of these would be:
- Concatenating your server certificate and CA intermediate certificate into
  an Nginx-usable cetificate file (Nginx can/will handle these bundles internally)
- Generating a Windows PFX (binary) certificate out of PEM private key and certificate


## Disto systemwide Certificate storage locations

Many different applications store the certs in the same diretory location.
This implies that the naming of certs has to be unique per application.

### RHEL

- Certs: /etc/pki/tls/certs/
- Private Keys:  /etc/pki/tls/private/

Converions: *.pem (either key or cert), Also: *.crt or *.key

### Ubuntu

- Certs: /etc/ssl/certs (Already lot of 
- ???: /etc/ssl/private/

Suffix Convention: *.crt = Cert, *.key = Private key *.pem, either

### FreeBSD
- Certs:  /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs


## Notes about Applications cert usage and converntions

- Some apps want certificates with fixed name (and location) and there is no config for the names
- Some apps have a default fixed/default name (and default location) for certificate, but you can customize / override this in app config file
- Some apps have no defaults (or unusable defaults) and require you to specify
  cetificate location in config

Most apps fall in the second / middle category.
