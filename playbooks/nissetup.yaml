# Linetboot NIS (and autofs) Client setup.
# Configure 4 key files related to NIS and autofs.
# Does very similar setup as post scripts (in scripts/) for OS installation.
# Inlines the templates for minimum of FS files dependency.
# If there are drastic customizations to defaultdomain, yp.conf and auto.master,
# Make a copy of your own and possibly use external files (content => src).
# Note: To pass/override arrays (e.g. nisservers here) you have to pass them
#  as JSON (either by inline -e '{...}' or file -e '@nispara.json'
